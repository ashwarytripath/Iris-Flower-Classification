## Iris Flower Classification

### Overview
The Iris dataset involves classifying iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project serves as an introductory classification task in machine learning.

### Dataset
The dataset includes measurements of iris flowers:
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- Target: Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

### Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Visualize the distribution of features and relationships between different species.

2. **Model Training**: Use machine learning classifiers (e.g., SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors) to classify iris flowers based on their measurements.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model accuracy and performance using cross-validation techniques.

### Results
The trained model achieves 100% accuracy, demonstrating its ability to classify iris flowers into their respective species accurately.
